Lesson 8
========

Today going to be doing a short review of sequences and a few more things about loops, but then going to code.org. The minecraft startup is also coming over to demo an updated version of their product.

Checkin
------

1. How was your day?
2. What do you wanna be when you grow up?
3. What's one thing that you remember from last Tuesday?


Introduction
----

Ok, we are going a short little review of Tuesday, then we are going to continue doing code.org stuff until free time. Also, the guys who are doing the circuit learning startup are here again. They will be coming around and asking you to volunteer if you want to try it out.

Whiteboard Review
-----

Can anyone tell me how to transform this using loops?

    MOVE FORWARD
    TURN RIGHT
    MOVE FORWARD
    TURN RIGHT
    MOVE FORWARD
    TURN RIGHT
    MOVE FORWARD
    TURN RIGHT

The correct answer should be:

    REPEAT 4 TIMES:
        MOVE FORWARD
        TURN RIGHT

Now, we were talking about it the artist the other day. Who is having trouble with the artist?

Does anyone know what "TURN RIGHT" would translate into using degrees? What is TURN RIGHT a short hand for?

    TURN RIGHT 90 DEGREES

In order to help you guys with the Artist problems. I am going to draw up the angles on the board.

Go through some of the tips for creating shapes and what angles they are.

Code.org
-----

Have them continue doing the code.org problems. If they get stuck help them out.


Clara
-----

Allow her some free time to be able to work on more scratch problems. But then, go through a couple of the modules for creating a website on codeacademy.com

Free time
-----

Allow free time at 5.
