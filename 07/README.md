Lesson 7
========

We've been doing quite a bit with Code.org and I want to continue with that. However, I also want to review concepts with the students and focus on them to make sure that they understand them. This class does not need to be done with a computer right now and is themed with the concept of coding sequences.

Checkin
------

1. How was your day?
2. How far have you gotten with code.org?
3. Do you think that you are learning more about programming?
4. What is one fun thing that you enjoyed doing on with code.org?


Introduction
----

Ok, well today we are going to do a review of what we have been learning in code.org. We are going to review coding sequences. Firstly, let's start with an excerise.

I am going to pass out a slip of paper. Write your name on paper and hand it one of the instructors. We are going to put every name into a hat/bucket. Ok, now I am going to be a robot. You are going to program me to move around the classroom. Becareful though because even though I am a robot I have feelings and bumping into things hurt. I am going to draw a name out of the hat and you get 3 instructions to give me. We are going to try and move me over to Mr. S's desk. If we get there early, we next step is to get me back up front, etc.

Control the Robot
-----

Draw names out of the hat and transverse the classroom according to class instruction. If they tell you to do something, you do it within reason. Also, if they program you into a table or chair, lightly run into it. This is show that the robot is only as good as the person giving the instructions.

If this is not getting to them or they are getting bored. Then this can be transitioned to asking someone to tell you how to draw a picture on the white board.

The main point of this excerise is again to show them that computers are only as smart as the ones giving instructions and we take a lot of things for granted. It is easy for us to pick up a pencil and draw a picture, but for a computer you need to break it down to smaller tasks. You have to tell the computer to lift their hand, etc.

Some of this sounds tedious or boring because who wants to write 1,000 lines of code telling a computer how to do something. Eventually though you will learn techniques like loops, conditionals, functions and recursion to make it so that you don't have to write so much.

Partner activity
-----

Ok, now we are going to pair off into two. We are going to take turns programming our friends. I am going to hand two sheets of paper with a maze in it. Your partner is going to take a pencil and you are going to tell him how to get through the maze. Your partner cannot lift the pencil/pen off the paper and should start at the place marked start and get to the the place marked finished.

You can only program your partner using 3 instructions.

* Turn left
* Turn right
* Move forward one space

Also, at any time you can say "Restart" and your partner can go back to start and try again.

When you tell your partner an instruction write down that instruction on your piece of paper. So that you have a copy of it.

Once, you finish, switch roles and use the other maze on the other sheet of paper.

(If they get done early, see if they can change up their code to use conditionals and loops)


Class-led Excerise
-----

Now, that we are all done with that did everyone get tired of writing "Move forward one space" at lot? Let's see if we can do something better.

Here is a simple maze: Draw a maze that starts from the top and moves down 5 spaces, turn right, one space, turn left, move up 5 spaces, turn right, move one space, turn right, move 5 spaces (a serpetine snake).

Can someone direct me to go from start to finish? Fields some answers from the kids, eventually, they will say move forward one space a lot, etc.

Get to the end of the maze. Now who things that is not very fun? We said move one space a lot of times right? Well, this is where a repeat block comes into play right? Now let's start from the beginning, we need to move our guy down how many spaces? (hopefully they all say 5). Ok, now instead of writing "Move forward one space" 5 times, we can do something like this:

Repeat 5 times:
    Move forward one space

Now, this makes our program shorter right?


Individual Activity
-----

Alright guys I got a couple different large puzzles here. They are bigger puzzles than last time. What you are going to do is solve the puzzle first using your pencil. Then, you are going to write a program that moves yourself from the start to the finish. This is the perfect place to use the "Repeat <#> times" command.

Raise your hand if you get stuck, or when you are done so that one of us can check your work.


Extra Time
-------

If there is extra time, then hand over a different maze for them to solve and have them try it again. Otherwise, allow them extra time to play on their computer.
