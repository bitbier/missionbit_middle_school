Mission Bit Middle School Lesson Plans

About
-----

This is a repo for keeping track lesson plans for teaching programming to kids at the Middle School level. Even though the class is "Intro Web Programming". We will be using and learning Scratch in order to teach basic concepts.

The goal of these lessons is to instill basic programming concepts in the student and give them the tools to develop interactive programs and games.

Each folder is a particular lesson starting with 02 and moving onwards since the first lesson was not exactly planned out.
