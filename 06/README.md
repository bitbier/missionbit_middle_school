Lesson 6
========

This lesson I am going to try something new. We are going to continue using code.org; however, this lesson will focus more on loops and angles as they are having some struggles with those topics.

This lesson will not need a computer. We are going to be working in groups and in front of the class to try and "be the computer" instead of relying on the "reset" and "play" button of the code.org tool.

Introduction
----

Starting the lesson first with a checkin questions:

1. What was one fun thing that you did today in school?
2. If you were here last week, what did you think of the people who were here doing the minecraft thing?
3. Do you want to learn more about hardware at all?
4. Are you getting stuck in the code.org lessons?
5. What is one thing that you want to learn today in class?

After doing the checking questions, talk to the class about what we are going to be doing. We'll not be using computers in this lesson but instead we are going to be the computer ourselves. We are going to work in groups and together to solve these looping problems. We are going to be using the "Artist" module to learn about loops and some review on angles.

Don't worry you will still have your free time at the end of the class and also if we get done earlier.

First Example
------

Just as a refresher we are going to be introducting loops. The first thing we will do is that I will show them a hand out that codes up a square object. I will be going step by step showing everyone how the code draws a square.

Now, I'll ask someone to show me how do I change this to use loops. (discuss in class). The answer is to use a loop over the move forward and turn by 90 degrees 4 times.

So I'll show them loop in and step through the code on the whiteboard again.

Group Problem
-------

We will be splitting the class into 3 groups (they can all roughly fit in 3 tables). Each group will be given paper and pencils. Each group will be given a separate sheet of with a unique problem attach to it. They will be responsible for doing the following things:

* As a group work together work out what the code will do. They will draw the shape from the code. Also have them pay attention to how the shape is drawn.
* Help everyone in the group understand how the shape the code is drawing.
* Come up to the front of the class and present their code and take turns drawing it up on the whiteboard for everyone to see.

This excerise does a couple of things. It allows them to talk it over and figure out what the code is doing. The code should be complex enough that it will take them a little bit of time to figure out. But also they will be showing the class (teaching the class) what they learned. Hopefully it will help it sink in a little better.

Once everyone is done with solving their problems. We'll have the entire group come up and show to the class and draw what they were working on. Also have handouts to show the other people in the class so that they can follow along.


Class lead problem
------

Now, will be handing out a sheet of paper to everyone or one to each group that has two shapes on it. Now, what is the code that we need to use in order to draw out these shapes?

Go through to the class to figure out the solution here. Also, offer suggestions about forget about the second shape. Let's focus on one shape first and then, we'll figure out the other problem later.

This brings up an important way of thinking about breaking the problem down into smaller pieces and solving those first which eventually leads to solving the bigger problem.


Group Problem 2
-------

Now, handing the group a very complicated picture or lines that is drawn. Each group should have a different problem. They are responsible to coming up with the code to draw that line. Remember to break the puzzle down into smaller pieces. If loops are still too complicated, let's come up with just the sequence to draw the shapes instead of using loops right from the get go.

Once, they have that down (depending on time), we can switch the problems around so that the groups have more practice.


Group Problem 3
-----

Now it is your turn to create something. Come up with something that you want to drawn and the code to draw it. Put them on seperate sheets, so that you have the drawing and you can hand over your code to another team. That team is going to try and figure out what you are drawing with your code. Once they figure it out, they will share with class what they found out.


Checkout
-----

Once enough time has done, before handing out laptops ask a few questions about today's class:

* Did anyone think this was hard?
* Did anyone think this was easy?
* What was one thing that you learned today?
* Did you have fun?


Free time
------

Hand over computers for a least 17 mins of free time like our class rules say.
