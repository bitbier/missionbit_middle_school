Prerequistes

Checkin
-------

Before class will ask few questions (taken from jamestown's way of starting class):

1. What did everyone do today?
2. Does anyone have any great plans for the weekend?
3. Did we have fun last lesson?
4. What do you want to learn today in class?

Lesson
-------

Today is a continuation of the code.org curriculum. Last time it went so well that we should continue it one more time to see if they like it more. However, there were a few pain points from last time when they came across problems that they could not figure out. So, on those lessons, we should do a class exercise where we can display the problem up on the projector and work through it.

This is the checkout before ending class. Ask these questions before giving them the 17 mins of free time:

2. Do you like this way of learn?
3. Should we keep doing this?
4. What do you want to learn next or do next lesson?

17 Mins of Free time

Allow them time to mess around and have fun, play their games. Go around the room and ask them questions on what they are doing interact and try to have fun with them.
