### Angles

Ok, we are going to do a quick review of Tuesday. Everyone stand up! We are going to do some more reviews on Angles. But we are going to add some twists to it.

First!

* Turn left 90º
* Turn right 180º
* Turn right 360º
* Turn left 90º

### Conditionals

Ok, so now we got angles down. If I raise my right hand, turn left 90º, if I raise my left hand, turn right 90º. Ready?

Raise a hand and allow them to turn. Do it one more time with different instructions.

Ok, does anyone know what we are just doing now? We are doing conditionals. If you haven't gotten to it yet, you will on code.org. There is the farmer that has conditionals for if there is a hole in the ground fill it, or if there is a pile of dirt, you can remove it.

Conditionals are very powerful because they allow us to let the computer decide what the best way to accomplish a task is.

Ok, we are going to plan little game of Simon says, except I am going to tell you what to do if I do something. If you get it wrong, sit down.

Do Simon Says game.
