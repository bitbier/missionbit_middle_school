### Pixels

Hey everyone! So, today we are going to be reviewing some of things that we are currently learning in code.org. After the review, we will continue with code.org, but hopefully this helps you with some of the concepts.

Firstly, I've been asked this question or some of you have confusing looks with the word "pixel" in the artist. Can anyone tell me what it is?

What if instead of saying "pixels", I said "inches"? When we look at a computer screen, you see a picture or the application that you are working on. If you look very, very close to the screen, everything on that screen is actually represented as dots, little tiny dots. Each of these dots form the overall image. We usually call these tiny dots a "pixel". (This is really just a oversimplication of the idea, but it works for now.) So when you see a command "Move forward 100 px". You are telling the computer to move 100 of those dots. It is just a computer measurement for distance on a screen.

### Angles

Another confusing thing that we are coming across is Angles. Can anyone tell me how many angles are in a complete circle? Ok, so for our purposes, we only have to deal with 360º. To turn 360º is to turn around in a full circle.

Can anyone tell me what is the angle to turn behind me? If the 360º is the full circle, how do I do half? 180º correct. Ok, so what happens when I turn right 90º? I am turning right.

There are lots of things that you can do with angles and I am not going to bore you with them right now. For now this is enough. Everyone stand up!

### Angle Spinning

Ok, everyone stand up and face me. I am going to stay some angles to turn and you are going to turn.

* Ok, so turn right 180º
* Turn left 90º
* Turn left 180º
* Turn right 90º
* Turn left 360º
* Turn left 45º

So, I said to turn left 45º. Explain how to figure out 45º.

So this is just generally useful to figure out other angles, if I were to say turn 60º, you know where 90º is and where 0º is it is somewhere between these two angle right?

Code.org
-------

Ok, continue with code.org. Try to use some of the things that just learned about angles in order to help figure out some of the angles that you need to draw some of the shapes. If you get stuck, we'll come around and help out.
